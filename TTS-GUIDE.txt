MODEL OPTIMIZATIONS:
========================================

The venmathi model is optimized for speed:
- Context: 2048 tokens (reduced from 4096)
- Max response: 256 tokens (keeps answers concise)
- Temperature: 0.7 (balanced creativity)
- Based on: llama3.2:1b (fastest, lightest model)

========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING:
========================================

If voice doesn't work:
1. Check browser permissions (allow audio)
2. Try Chrome/Edge (best TTS support)
3. Check speaker icon is enabled (not muted)
4. Open browser console (F12) for errors

If responses are slow:
1. Close other applications
2. Model is already optimized for speed
3. First response is slower (model loading)
